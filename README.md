# Snake-Game-Improved

<p>I've already created a snake game before but back then it was my first time to create a game with C and of course i had no enough experience in game dev so the game was just terrible even this one is not as good as you might expect but it's improved in terms of the way you play the game and also made it a little bit more challenging by making the game speed increases when the score reaches 10 or a multiple of 10 until it's no longer playable.</p>

<h2>Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Converted the whole movement system into a grid based movement system which makes the movement of the snake so smooth when to comes to moving into a specific direction to follow food</li>
<li>Improved the spwaning food algorithm so that it won't clash with the positions of the snake body (mostly)</li>
<li>Made the game a little bit more challenging by increasing the speed of the snake movement every single time the score is 10 or a multiple of 10</li>
</ul>
